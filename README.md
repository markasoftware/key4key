# Key4Key

Key4Key is an automated helper tool for https://reddit.com/r/circleoftrust. It allows players to swap passwords with other users automatically, and apply constraints upon the players who you swap with, such as a minimum karma limit, minimum circle size limit, etc.

Key4Key has several notable features:
* Automating banning of anybody who betrays someone else (based on flair)
* Matching constraints
* Automatic circle password verification
* Simple, mobile-friendly web UI
